The U.S. Web Design System was created by a collaborative team at 18F and the U.S. Digital Service in 2015, under the guidance of an advisory board of talented, experienced government workers in the CFPB, the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Social Security Administration, the Department of Education, the Internal Revenue Service, and GSA. It is currently a project of GSA’s [Technology Transformation Services](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services), maintained by the Office of Products and Programs.
